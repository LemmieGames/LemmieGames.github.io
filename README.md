Hi uh...

Feidull are scaled, deer-like monsters that have taken over the Cainur Forest. Their colouration and the moss-like growth on their back helps them blend in amongst the trees. They appear to be solitary creatures and tend to act aggressively towards anything they perceive as a threat. Despite this, they are herbivores and won't eat the creatures they fight- so playing dead is a viable escape tactic.
